# Kolberg's Games Platform Constitution

## Purpose
The platform hosts multiple independent games for children, presented through a single shared platform page and deployed as a static website.

## Core Principles

1. Static-first  
   The platform and all games must work on static hosting such as GitHub Pages.

2. Independent games  
   Each game is a self-contained mini application with its own HTML, JavaScript, and styling.

3. Optional sharing  
   Games may use shared utilities or assets, but are not required to do so.

4. Isolation  
   One game must not affect or break other games or the platform itself.

5. Clear structure  
   Platform code, individual games, shared utilities, and assets must live in clearly separated directories.

6. Simple navigation  
   Users must be able to enter a game from the platform page and return back easily.

7. Child-friendly by design  
   All games and platform interactions must remain simple, safe, and predictable for children.

8. Backend optional  
   No backend or database is required for core functionality. If added later, it must not be mandatory for existing games.

9. Future growth  
   The platform must allow adding new games, shared utilities, or shared assets without modifying existing games.
