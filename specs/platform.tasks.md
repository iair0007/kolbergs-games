# Platform Page Tasks

## Goal
Create a platform landing page that lists all available games and allows children to select and play them.

The page should be visually appealing and friendly for kids, with an emphasis on a playful, colorful style suitable for boys.

---

## Task 1: Define platform entry point
- Decide the platform entry HTML file location
- Ensure it can be reached from the site root
- Ensure games can link back to it easily

---

## Task 2: Define game listing data
- Decide how the platform knows which games exist
- Use a simple, static approach suitable for GitHub Pages
- Avoid inspecting game code at runtime

---

## Task 3: Create basic platform HTML structure
- Add a clear title for the platform
- Add a container for listing games
- Ensure layout works on desktop and tablets

---

## Task 4: Add kid-friendly styling
- Use large buttons or cards
- Use bright, playful colors
- Avoid small text or subtle UI elements
- Ensure strong visual separation between games

---

## Task 5: Implement game navigation
- Clicking a game navigates to its entry page
- Navigation uses simple links, not complex routing
- Platform page does not load game code

---

## Task 6: Verify usability
- Platform page loads without errors
- Games can be entered and exited
- UI is easy to understand without reading instructions

---

## Non-Goals
- No animations required initially
- No backend or persistence
- No dynamic content loading
